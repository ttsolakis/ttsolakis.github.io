My path into robotics began during my studies in **Mechanical Engineering** at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, where I became fascinated by the dynamics and control of mechanical systems. As a member of the Formula Student team, I helped design and build a competitive race car, gaining first-hand experience in combining theory, engineering practice, and teamwork to solve real-world challenges.  

To deepen my knowledge, I pursued a Masterâ€™s in **Systems and Control** at TU Delft, specializing in advanced control theory and multi-agent systems. My thesis on distributed passivity-based control introduced me to international and interdisciplinary collaboration, where I enjoyed turning theoretical concepts into functioning algorithms.  

This path led me to a PhD in **Cognitive Robotics** at TU Delft, focusing on safe and fault-tolerant motion planning for autonomous surface vehicles. My research combined Finite-State Machines, Model Predictive Control, and Set-Membership Estimation to develop algorithms that respect maritime rules while remaining resilient to disturbances and faults. Beyond research, I collaborated with colleagues, co-supervised MSc students, and presented my work at international conferences.  

In my free time, I look for ways to explore and experience the world. From hiking and climbing in the mountains to sailing or scuba diving at sea, I am drawn to the outdoors for the sense of adventure and perspective it brings. I also enjoy long motorbike trips, which combine exploration with the freedom of the open road. For me, these activities are more than hobbies â€” they are ways to challenge myself, share moments with others, and keep learning from the world around me.

My ambition is to contribute to technologies that make the world a bit better, step by step.
