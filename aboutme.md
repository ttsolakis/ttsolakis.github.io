title: About Me
---

Hi, I’m **Tasos** 👋  

I’m a robotics and control engineer with a passion for developing intelligent, reliable autonomous systems. I recently completed my PhD at **TU Delft (Cognitive Robotics)**, following a Master’s in **Systems & Control**.  

My work focuses on **motion planning**, **model predictive control (MPC)**, and **fault-tolerant autonomy**. I have hands-on experience designing and deploying algorithms in **ROS2**, validating them on ground robots and autonomous surface vessels. Beyond research, I enjoy writing clean, well-documented code and turning theoretical ideas into practical, real-time solutions.  

Key areas of expertise:  
- Motion planning and rule-compliant navigation  
- Robust and fault-tolerant MPC  
- Set-membership estimation (SME) for online fault diagnosis  
- ROS2-based system integration (Python/C++)  

I thrive in collaborative, interdisciplinary teams and enjoy bridging theory with application. Outside of work, you’ll often find me climbing, hiking in the Alps, or planning my next motorbike adventure 🚴‍♂️🏔️.
