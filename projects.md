## Autonomous Rover (Home Project)  
**ROS2 · Raspberry Pi 5 · LiDAR · IMU · Odometry**  
A personal project to build a 4-wheel differential rover with full onboard autonomy.  
- SLAM and perception on one Raspberry Pi using LiDAR–IMU–odometry data.  
- Motion planning and control on a second Raspberry Pi.  
- Goal: hands-on experience in hardware/software integration with ROS2 while experimenting with autonomous navigation.

## Wildfire Monitoring and Detection (FLARE)  
**UAVs · Solar Power · Autonomy · Fire Detection**  
Concept for a solar-powered, long-endurance UAV system for early wildfire detection and continuous monitoring.  
- Vision: persistent aerial coverage with thermal/RGB cameras and onboard autonomy.  
- Current status: developing a Python-based wildfire simulator to study fire spread and detection strategies.  
- Next steps: platform and payload sizing, and integration of the autonomy stack.

## Rule-Compliant and Fault-Tolerant Motion Planning for Autonomous Surface Vessels  
**Model Predictive Control (MPC) · Set-Membership Estimation (SME) · Reconfigurable MPC · Maritime Rules (COLREGs)**  
PhD research on safe and resilient planning for ASVs.  
- Integrated maritime traffic rules into finite-state machines and MPC for rule-compliant navigation.  
- Developed SME-based parameter estimation for online fault diagnosis.  
- Designed reconfigurable/robust MPC planners to maintain safety under actuator faults and disturbances.  
- Validated through ROS-based simulations with dynamic obstacles.

## Vehicle Dynamics & Torque Vectoring  
**Control Systems · Vehicle Dynamics · Simulation**  
Studied the effect of power distribution architectures on vehicle dynamics and designed a torque-vectoring controller.  
- Built multibody dynamics models for different power distribution strategies.  
- Designed a sliding-mode controller for 4-wheel torque-vectoring.  
- Performed comparative analysis across architectures.

## Formula Student Race Car (Team Project)  
**Mechanical Design · CAD/CAE · Teamwork**  
Member of the Aristotle Racing Team, contributing to the design and build of a Formula Student race car.  
- Led the design, structural analysis, and manufacturing of the tubular steel frame.  
- Coordinated subsystem integration and overall vehicle assembly.  
- Achieved top-10 placements in international competitions.
