    My path into robotics began during my studies in Mechanical Engineering at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, where I became fascinated with the dynamics and control of mechanical systems.
    As a member of the Formula Student team, I helped design and build a competitive race car, gaining first-hand experience in combining theory, engineering practice, and teamwork to solve real-world challenges.

    To deepen my knowledge, I pursued a Master’s in Systems and Control at TU Delft, specializing in advanced control theory and multi-agent systems.
    My thesis on distributed passivity-based control introduced me to international and interdisciplinary collaboration, where I enjoyed turning theoretical concepts into functioning algorithms.

    This path led me to a PhD in Cognitive Robotics at TU Delft, focusing on safe and fault-tolerant motion planning for autonomous surface vehicles.
    My research combined Finite-State Machines, Model Predictive Control, and Set-Membership Estimation to develop algorithms that respect maritime rules while remaining resilient to disturbances and faults.
    Beyond research, I collaborated with colleagues, co-supervised MSc students, and presented my work at international conferences.

    In my free time, I explore and experience the world—hiking and climbing in the mountains, sailing or scuba diving at sea, and taking long motorbike trips that combine exploration with the freedom of the open road.
    For me, these activities are more than hobbies—they are ways to challenge myself, share moments with others, and keep learning from the world around me.
    My ambition is to contribute to technologies that make the world a bit better, step by step.
