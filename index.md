<p style="text-align: center;">
I'm <strong>Anastasios (Tasos) Tsolakis</strong>, a robotics engineer passionate about motion planning and control.  
I recently completed my PhD in <strong>Cognitive Robotics</strong> at TU Delft, where I focused on rule-compliant motion planning and fault-tolerant control for autonomous surface vessels.

<p style="text-align: center;">
I enjoy building systems that bridge rigorous theory with real-world engineering.
